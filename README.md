# Happy International Men's Day!

This project has started to celebrate the yearly International Men's Day!  
Unfortunately, Google decided to only celebrate the International Women's Day by replacing the logo.

## Preview
Installing this script exchanges the google logo by a custom holiday logo.

## Installation
You'll need a browser extension such as [violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) ([open source](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey) ftw) and import the script.
It should work for google with any top level domain.
